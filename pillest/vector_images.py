"""
This module is for vector images.

I have chosen SVG as a the main format for the images.

Please see this reference.

https://svgwg.org/svg2-draft/\

I will work to make the implementation respect SVG 2.0 (As of this time still a draft)

__NOTE__:
Graphics defined with SVG have many different applications.
As a result, not all software that uses SVG will have the same features.
Conformance to the SVG specification is therefore not a binary matter;
 software may be conforming within a restricted feature set.
